We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Git workflow
CPG uses this `Git Feature Branch Workflow` workflow to ensure we have a standard, click [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) to read more.
But a quick summerization:
1. Fetch.
2. Be in `develop` branch
3. Pull.
4. Create a issue/feature of what you want to change
5. Create a branch with format of `feature/ISSUE_ID-NAME-OF-CHOICE` (ISSUE_ID is the id of the issue you created on `4`)
6. Code
7. Commit each change and pull/merge from develop
8. Once done create a `PR`
9. Once merged repeat for new features/ideas.
