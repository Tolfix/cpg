# üìã | Documentation
You can read our documentation on our [`wiki.`](https://github.com/Tolfix/CPG-API/wiki)

# üì¶ | Setup
Setting up **CPG** can be done in various ways, but by far the simplest is by using **Docker**.

You can pull the latest **Docker Image** from `tolfixorg/cpg:latest` from **DockerHub**.

**CPG** also needs environment variables added, which you can find in [`.env.example`](), those that have (optional) in the comment can be ignored if you don't feel the need for them, but the others are required to make CPG functional.

# üîß | Installing
**CPG** requires the following
* Node.js v14 or v16
* Typescript - 4.3.5
* MongoDB
* Git

1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tolfix/CPG-API
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Install `TypeScript`
```bash
npm install -g typescript@4.3.5
```

## üë∑ | Building
**CPG** is built from **TypeScript**, so you can run it by using the compiler.
```bash
tsc -b
npm run build
```

# üëü | Running
You can run *CPG* by executing `npm run start` or `node ./build/Main.js`.
I Would recommend you use `pm2`.

# üé® | Plugins
Plugins allow you to add others features to CPG.
Beware, it can be `dangerous` as plugins get access to a lot of low level features.
You can trust `Tolfix` plugins, or plugins you created yourself, otherwise there is no guarantee on stability or security.
If you want to create your own plugin, check out [`cpg-plugin-template`](https://github.com/Tolfix/cpg-plugin-template) to create you're own!

## Installing
You can add new plugins by modifying the environment variable "PLUGIN" as an array of strings.
`PLUGINS=["cpg-plugin-discord-webhook", "cpg-plugin-"]`
This will install the plugin via `npm`.

## Deleting
To delete a plugin, simply remove it from the environment variable "PLUGIN" as an array of strings.
`PLUGINS=[]`
This will uninstall the plugin via `npm`.
