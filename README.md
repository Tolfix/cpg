# ‚≠ê | CPG

CPG is being used to create items, generate invoices, handle orders, view transactions, and ensure payments make it to the client to develop your business. It offers many approaches for developers to personalize CPG

# Making domain package

1. Copy `dummy` folder and paste in `packages` folder
2. Rename with the format: `cpg-{package_name}`
3. In `package.json` replace name with: `@cpg/{package_name}`
4. Install dependencies in root with `npm i` (To sync with node_modules too)
5. Makes changes and once done run with `npm run build -w=cpg/{package_name}`

### Installing domain package to apps

1. Go to app and to `package.json`
2. Decide if it goes to dev or not
3. Add a new line with the following: `"@cpg/{package_name}": "*"` (Star is needed)
4. Go to root and run: `npm i`.

This should install the dependency
